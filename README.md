Segment tree for bytes in Go

Based on [Thomas Obernd√∂rfer's int range segment tree](https://github.com/toberndo/go-stree) with fixing/optimization/modification for bytes ranges.

1. For build once, query many models
2. Not design for big data set 
(better for <= 1024 intervals, otherwise the cost will be quite high when query a big range. Bench it before using. 
For small count intervals. e.g., 1024, the point query will be ~100ns if only one interval id will be returned)
3. Not design for interval has long bytes as range
4. Using pseudo-codes in [Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications, INSERTSEGMENTTREE](http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/pseudo.pdf) &
codes in [another segment tree implementation](https://github.com/seppestas/go-segtree) to fix
wrong query result for some corner cases. See `func TestMissingResult(t *testing.T)` in [bstree_test.go](bstree_test.go)

## Details of Implementation

1. Using uint64 as abbreviated key for speeding up query & push, which means long keys with long common prefix won't work with this lib.
2. Build is slow, offline building is preferred in production environment.
3. Invoker has responsibility to map the id and target, query will only return the id. ID is started from 0, each push will plus 1.
